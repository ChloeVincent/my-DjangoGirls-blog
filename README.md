# My first Django blog

Available at [chloe-django-blog.appspot.com](http://chloe-django-blog.appspot.com/)

I started by creating a simple Django app thanks to Django girls tutorial.
I then customized it to query the Kew database via the pykew package.
Finally I connected to a Google Cloud SQL database and deployed the app on Google Cloud App Engine. 
I documented the steps on my [github website](https://chloevincent.github.io/).

My Django app contains a page of blog posts detailing my career and education so far, and provides the possibility to [query Kew's database](http://chloe-django-blog.appspot.com/species_info/)
